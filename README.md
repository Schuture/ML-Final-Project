# ML-Final-Project

Final project of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning", group members: Yixiong Chen (ychen646), Zuojun Zhou (zzhou111), Susan Wang, (qwang95), Yuhao Zheng (yzhen130).

In this project, we implement and compare popular ML methods for voice recognition for celebrities. It contains two parts: traditional machine learning algorithms, and deep neural networks (including the SOTA models).

## Dataset preperation

We use the [VoxCeleb1](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html) dataset, containing 1211 celebrities, 21,819 videos, and 153,516 audio clips.

## Environment

Please use ```requirements.txt``` to install all the dependencies.

## ML algorithms


## DL algorithms

Please refer to ```DL VoxCeleb analysis.ipynb``` for the DL-based methods.
